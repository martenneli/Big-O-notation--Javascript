# Comparing the speed of two blocks of code  (Big O Notation)
Big O notation code 1 and Big O notation code 2

     although the two blocks of code essentially are used to achieve the same purpose:
            ==>one turns out to be faster than the other.
            To demonstrate this I have used console.log to capture performance.now();
            on a simple example. 
            
            
            This approach is more of a time complexity than space complexity using the Big O notation 
            
            code one falls under o(n) while code two falls under O(1)
            what does this mean?
            code two uses a constant number of operations regrdless of the size of n.
            code 1 operations are not constant.They tend to increase with an increase in the value of n
            this impacts the time taken to get the desired output.
            
            code two would thus be faster than code one!
            
          NB:  different machine takes different time(s) to run the blocks of code ; my machine achieved the times on the pics :)
            
            
  O(1), O(n), O(n^{2}), O(log n), O(n log n) among others are sample notations we can use to classify our code!!
